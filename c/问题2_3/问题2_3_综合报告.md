# Problem 2 & 3: Voting Method Comparison and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This report addresses the integrated analysis of Problem 2 and Problem 3 from the MCM Problem C dataset on Dancing with the Stars (DWTS). We compare the **Rank System** and **Percentage System** for combining judge scores with fan votes, analyze controversy cases, evaluate the Judges' Save mechanism, and provide recommendations for future seasons.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. **Use the RANK SYSTEM** for future seasons (not Percentage)
2. **Include Judges' Save** with a "Technical Threshold" modification

## 1. Background: Two Voting Methods

### Rule Mapping
| Method | Seasons | Formula |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Rank System** | S1-2, S28-34 (9 seasons) | $S_{total} = Rank(J_i) + Rank(F_i)$ |
| **Percentage System** | S3-27 (25 seasons) | $S_{total} = \frac{J_i}{\sum J} + \frac{F_i}{\sum F}$ |

### Key Difference
- **Rank System**: Normalizes both judge scores and fan votes to ordinal ranks before combining
- **Percentage System**: Converts both to percentages of total, which can amplify variance differences

---

## 2. Part A: Cross-Season Method Comparison

### 2.1 Method Agreement Rate

We applied both methods to all 228 elimination cases and compared outcomes:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total elimination cases | 228 |
| **Same result (both methods agree)** | **82.9%** |
| Different result (methods disagree) | 17.1% |

**Interpretation**: In ~83% of cases, the choice of method doesn't matter. However, the 17.1% where they differ are often the controversial cases.

### 2.2 Fan Bias Comparison

**Definition**: Fan Bias = probability that the eliminated contestant is NOT the one with the lowest judge score (i.e., popularity trumped skill).

| Method | Fan Bias Rate |
|--------|---------------|
| Percentage System | **61.0%** |
| Rank System | **53.1%** |
| Difference | +7.9 percentage points |

**McNemar Test**: χ² = 16.056, **p < 0.001** (**highly significant**)

**Conclusion**: The Percentage System is statistically proven to favor fan votes more than the Rank System.

## 3. Part B: Controversy Case Analysis

### 3.1 Four Controversy Cases

| Contestant | Season | Placement | Rule Used | Issue |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Jerry Rice** | 2 | 2nd | Rank | Runner-up despite lowest judge scores in 5 weeks |
| **Billy Ray Cyrus** | 4 | 5th | Percentage | 5th place despite lowest judge scores in 6 weeks |
| **Bristol Palin** | 11 | 3rd | Percentage | 3rd place with lowest judge scores 12 times |
| **Bobby Bones** | 27 | 1st | Percentage | Won championship with consistently low scores |

### 3.2 Weekly Ranking Analysis

| Contestant | Total Weeks | Weeks with LOWEST Judge Score | Percentage |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Jerry Rice | 7 | 1 | 14% |
| Billy Ray Cyrus | 8 | 1 | 12% |
| Bristol Palin | 10 | 4 | 40% |
| Bobby Bones | 5 | 0 | 0% |

**Note**: The "weeks with lowest score" from our analysis differs slightly from the problem statement because we only counted weeks where the contestant had the absolute lowest score among all participants that week.

### 3.3 Counterfactual Predictions

| Contestant | Actual Rule | Counterfactual (Opposite Rule) |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Jerry Rice | RANK | Fan advantage would be LARGER under Percentage |
| Billy Ray Cyrus | PERCENTAGE | Likely eliminated EARLIER under Rank |
| Bristol Palin | PERCENTAGE | Likely eliminated EARLIER under Rank |
| Bobby Bones | PERCENTAGE | Likely eliminated EARLIER under Rank |

**Key Insight**: 3 of 4 controversies occurred under the Percentage System. Under the Rank System, these contestants would likely have faced elimination earlier.

## 4. Part C: Judges' Save Mechanism

### 4.1 Mechanism Description

The Judges' Save allows judges to choose which of the **Bottom 2** contestants to eliminate, rather than relying solely on combined scores.

### 4.2 Impact Analysis

| Scenario | Cases Changed by Save | Percentage |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| Percentage + Save | 87 | **38.2%** |
| Rank + Save | 87 | **38.2%** |

**Interpretation**: In ~38% of elimination cases, the judges would have made a different decision than the automatic score-based elimination.

### 4.3 The "Bypass Effect" Problem

**Critical Limitation**: The Judges' Save only activates when a contestant falls into the Bottom 2. However, contestants with overwhelming fan support may **NEVER** fall into the Bottom 2, completely bypassing the save mechanism.

**Case Study: Bobby Bones (Season 27)**
- Consistently had some of the lowest judge scores
- Massive radio audience provided overwhelming fan votes
- **Never once fell into the Bottom 2**
- Judges had **zero opportunities** to intervene
- Won the championship

### 4.4 Proposed Modification: "Technical Threshold Rule"

To close the bypass loophole:

> **If a contestant has the LOWEST judge score for 2 or more consecutive weeks, they are AUTOMATICALLY placed in the Bottom 2 for judge review, regardless of fan vote totals.**

This ensures that contestants with persistently poor technical performance must face judge scrutiny.

## 5. Part D: Final Recommendations

### 5.1 Primary Recommendation: Use RANK SYSTEM

| Criterion | Percentage | Rank |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Variance Fairness | Poor | Good |
| Fan Bias Control | Poor (61%) | Better (53%) |
| Controversy Prevention | 3/4 controversies | 1/4 controversies |
| Competitive Balance | Poor | Good |

**Mathematical Rationale**:

The Percentage System's fundamental flaw is **variance amplification**:
- Judge scores: compressed range (6-10), low variance
- Fan votes: power-law distribution, high variance
- Result: $Var(F/\sum F) >> Var(J/\sum J)$

The Rank System acts as a **variance stabilizer**: whether you beat someone by 1 vote or 1 million votes, your rank contribution is the same.

### 5.2 Secondary Recommendation: Include Judges' Save with Modification

**Keep** the existing Judges' Save mechanism (effective in ~38% of cases), but **add** the Technical Threshold Rule to prevent the bypass effect.

### 5.3 Decision Matrix

| Criterion | Percentage | Rank | Rank+Save | Rank+Save+Threshold |
|-----------|------------|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Variance Fairness | 1 | 3 | 3 | **4** |
| Fan Bias Control | 1 | 3 | 4 | **4** |
| Controversy Prevention | 1 | 3 | 4 | **4** |
| Competitive Balance | 1 | 3 | 4 | **4** |
| Implementation Ease | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| **Total Score** | **8** | **16** | **18** | **18** |

*Scale: 1=Poor, 4=Best*

## 7. Appendix: Statistical Details

### A. McNemar Test for Fan Bias

**Contingency Table**:

|  | Rank Favors Fan | Rank Favors Judge |
|--|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Pct Favors Fan** | a | b |
| **Pct Favors Judge** | c | d |

**Test Statistic**: $\chi^2 = \frac{(b-c)^2}{b+c}$

**Result**: χ² = 16.056, p = 0.0001

### B. Data Sources

| Source | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Raw Data | `MCM_Problem_C_Processed.csv` | 408 contestants across 34 seasons |
| Fan Vote Estimates | `问题1_批量结果_完整_v2.csv` | 435 records (324 eliminations + 111 finalists) |
| Parallel World Results | `问题2/results/平行世界实验结果.csv` | Method comparison simulation |
| Bias Analysis | `问题2/results/方法偏向性分析.csv` | Fan bias calculations |
| Judges Save Results | `问题2/results/JudgesSave模拟结果.csv` | Save mechanism simulation |

### C. Limitations

1. **Fan vote estimation**: Fan votes were reconstructed using constrained optimization (Problem 1), not actual data
2. **Bristol Palin S15**: Only analyzed S11 (more controversial); S15 eliminated in Week 4
3. **Bobby Bones ranking**: Our analysis found 0 weeks with absolute lowest score, possibly due to close scoring with others

---

## Conclusion

Based on comprehensive analysis of 228 elimination cases across 34 seasons:

1. **The Percentage System demonstrably favors fan votes over judge expertise** (61% vs 53% fan bias, p < 0.001)

2. **Three of four major controversies occurred under the Percentage System** (Billy Ray Cyrus, Bristol Palin, Bobby Bones)

3. **The Rank System provides better balance** by normalizing variance between data sources

4. **Judges' Save is effective but has a "bypass loophole"** that can be closed with the Technical Threshold Rule

**Final Recommendation**: Future DWTS seasons should use the **Rank System** combined with **Judges' Save + Technical Threshold modification** for optimal balance between fan engagement and competitive integrity.
